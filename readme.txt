The goal of this project was to provide a highlight of a variety of statistical tools and methods. The data was courtesty of the Lahman's Baseball Database and the analysis was done within R. This project is certainly not a full representation of my knowledge but rather somewhat of a foundation of my skills. Although there is not a lot of in-depth applied statistics within this project, it does lead to questions that can be answered more eloquently and completely with more specialized techniques.
